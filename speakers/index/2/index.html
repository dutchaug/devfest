        <div class="summary">
<p>Kars Veling studied Computer Science and Business School at University Twente, and founded <a href="http://www.q42.nl">Q42</a> in 2000. </p>

<p>Kars is currently CTO of Q42, which employs 50 engineers at the moment. He founded Q42 to create a company that would be cool and interesting enough for himself to work for (In that time, a lot of boring, accountant-steered companies were selling warm IT bodies to customers). Q42's tagline then was <em>"The User Friendly Internet"</em> which is still standing strong today.</p>

<p>Kars is both a Software Engineer and a Business Engineer. He played key roles in -amongst others- the technical architecture for the Philips HUE Project, Staatsloterij, Schooltas and D-reizen.</p>
