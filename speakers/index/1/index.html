        <div class="summary">
<p>Software Engineer and Instructor at <a href="http://bignerdranch.com">Big Nerd Ranch</a>.</p>

<p>Chris grabbed all of our attention by becoming our inaugural Clash of the Coders champion, an honor he&rsquo;d been preparing for ever since checking out the world&rsquo;s largest HTML book from his high school library. Before his reign at the Ranch, he wrote code in the corporate world after completing his Masters at Georgia Tech. In addition to brandishing some mean engineering skills, Chris is our resident Frisbee ace. He fuels all that energy with gummy bears and nearly anything smothered in Ranch dressing or barbecue sauce. He dreams of washing all of that &ldquo;goodness&rdquo; down by someday partaking in a gin and tonic with &ldquo;Top Gear&rdquo; co-host James May.</p>
