<p>QAFE, short for Quality Application Framework for Enterprises, was established in 2008 by Paul Mehilal and Rokesh Jankie as a software division of Qualogy. Challenged by the dynamic nature and short lifecycle of technology frameworks, Rokesh started engineering a new platform based on Google Web Toolkit that would enable the development of applications independently of back and front ends.</p>

<p>QAFE allows you to recycle legacy applications, build applications from scratch and execute your mobile strategy to an anywhere, anyplace collaboration. It also offers a one-of-a-kind Oracle Forms modernization tool, that lets you unlock legacy applications to any modern frontend of your choice.</p>

<p>As of 2013, QAFE has offices in the US, Europe and South America, and services clients on all continents.</p>
